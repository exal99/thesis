\section{Simulations}
Different simulations were created to simulate the different behaviors of the transistor and to calibrate the physics model. This section describes the different simulations.

\subsection{Standalone Fin Simulation}
The first simulation created was the standalone fin simulation as seen in \cref{fig:fin}. This was used to calibrate the interface mobility models described in \cref{sec:mobility}. The effective mobility of the fin was calibrated to match the measured effective mobility in \cite{Gribisch2023}.

\subsection{Full Device Simulations}
Using the calibrated mobility models the full device, as seen in \cref{fig:full_device}, could be simulated. The first simulation was a $V_g$ sweep. Using this simulation the source contact resistance was calibrated.
